Hello everyone. Here is my first bit more complex spring boot application code, the Task Manager. You can find here login form and registration without security and collections (categories) and tasks saved in specific collection. Collections or tasks have  possibility to delete, edit, sorting, mark as completed. Everything works together with Posgresql database. I used css and thymeleaf for frontend as well together with common design file.
